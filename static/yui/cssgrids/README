Module Name: "cssgrids"
Documentation: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssgrids

The foundational CSS Grids offers four preset page widths, 
six preset two-column source-order-independent content 
templates, and the ability to stack and nest subdivided 
regions of two, three, or four columns. The file provides 
over 1000 page layout combinations. Other features include:

    * Supports fluid 100-percent layouts, fluid- and 
      fixed-width layouts at 750px, 950px, and 974px 
      centered, and the ability to easily customize the 
      width.
    * Flexible in response to user initiated font-size 
      adjustments.
    * Template columns are source-order independent; put
      your most important content earlier in your markup
      for improved accessibility and SEO.
    * Self-clearing footer. No matter which column is
      longer, the footer stays below the longest.
    * Accommodates IAB's Ad Unit Guidelines for common 
      ad dimensions.
