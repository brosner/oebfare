oebfare is the source code that runs my blog at http://oebfare.com. I felt it
would be good to release the source code freely so others can learn more
about Django.

Since this code is publically available I encourage people to actually use it. 
With that said, it would be a good idea to provide some nice details about
how to use it.

You likely already cloned it from GitHub. If not here is how you might do
that::

    git clone git://github.com/brosner/oebfare.git

If for any reason GitHub is down or inaccesible to you I have mirrored the
repository and can be cloned like::

    git clone git://oebfare.com/oebfare.git

You are now all set with the source code.

To get it running you will need to ensure you have the dependencies fulfilled.
I am going to assume that is already done. You are now going to want to make
a ``local_settings.py`` file where you can add in your own settings. The most
common settings that get set here are:

 * ``LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT``
 * ``DEBUG``
 * ``DATABASE_ENGINE``
 * ``DATABASE_HOST``
 * ``DATABASE_NAME``
 * ``DATABASE_PASSWORD``
 * ``DATABASE_PORT``
 * ``DATABASE_USER``
 * ``EMAIL_HOST``
 * ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``
 * ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``
 * ``EMAIL_PORT``
 * ``EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX``
 * ``EMAIL_USE_TLS``
 * ``MEDIA_ROOT``
 * ``MEDIA_URL``

This is by no means a complete list. This were the ones I have needed to
configure myself. You will have to setup your database settings so be sure
to set those up as they are required.

I have a special setting named ``LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT`` that is used to control
whether media in ``MEDIA_ROOT`` is served up at ``MEDIA_URL`` by default when
running ``runserver``. This is handy for testing, but please do not use it
in production. The setting name should defer that I hope.

Once you have your database settings all set you can now::

    ./manage.py syncdb

Then::

    ./manage.py runserver

The blog is going to look exactly like mine, but the idea is that you can
change whatever you want or ignore everything I said an copy out the apps you
want in your project.
