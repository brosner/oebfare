You're all set!

Installing
----------

To get yourself up and running with oebfare you have two options. Install the
dependancies (listed above) manually or grab pip. The preferred way of setting
things up is to work with pip and virtualenv. For the former, you are on your
own. If you don't have pip or virtualenv here is a quick setup guide::

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv

You don't have to use ``sudo``, but I did to show you it really should be
installed globally. The last thing I *highly* recommend is using Doug Hellman's
virtualenvwrapper::

    sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

Head to http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper/ and read the quick
setup to get virtualenvwrapper going for yourself. I will assume that is done
correctly.

Set up yourself a virtualenv for working with the oebfare code (you can use
any env name below)::

    mkvirtualenv oebfare
    easy_install pip

Now you are ready to install the dependancies using pip. Make sure you in the
root of the oebfare source tree::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You are all set!

Configuration
-------------

All settings should be provided in a ``local_settings.py`` file. This file is
imported by ``settings.py`` to override any already defined settings. The only
disadvantage to this method is you don't have access to the original values
to append or modify in place (this shouldn't be a big deal). The most common
settings you should likely need to configure are:

 * ``LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT``
 * ``DEBUG``
 * ``DATABASE_ENGINE``
 * ``DATABASE_HOST``
 * ``DATABASE_NAME``
 * ``DATABASE_PASSWORD``
 * ``DATABASE_PORT``
 * ``DATABASE_USER``
 * ``EMAIL_HOST``
 * ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``
 * ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``
 * ``EMAIL_PORT``
 * ``EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX``
 * ``EMAIL_USE_TLS``
 * ``MEDIA_ROOT``
 * ``MEDIA_URL``

This is by no means a complete list. The most important settings are going
to be the database settings. Make sure you set them correctly.

Notice the ``LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT`` settings. This setting is used to control
whether the media in ``MEDIA_ROOT`` is served up at ``MEDIA_URL`` by default
when running ``runserver``. This is handy for testing, but please do not use it
in production. The setting name should hopefully defer that.

Once you have your database settings configured go ahead and syncdb::

    python manage.py syncdb

And finally you can run the development server::

    python manage.py runserver
